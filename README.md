# PixelWRLD
The game is a collaborative pixel canvas where multiple users participate and can place pixels. The objective of the game is to work together and coordinate actions to create and preserve diverse images on the shared canvas.

The game field consists of a grid that contains numerous pixels of different colors. Each player can choose a color and place a pixel of that color on an available spot on the field.

This game concept is inspired by "r/place," where users collaboratively built and modified a shared canvas by placing pixels of various colors.
